								<h2>Mechanical Engineering Intern â€“ U of M Architecture, Engineering and Construction</h2>
								<h3>Scope</h3>
								<p>Worked alongside design, operations and maintenance and construction engineers as well as 
									architects over the 2024 summer and for the 2024 fall semester. I also had the opportunity to communicate within
									departments to ensure we had the approval to enter some of the older buildings safely and with proper
									authorization. 
								 </p>
								 <p>
									My first projects involved communicating with a previous intern on updating chilled water schematics. This project
									introduced me to surveying buildings and retracing piping to update/develop schematics for chilled water or condensed 
									air piping. This involved over 50+ different chilled water drawings of various buildings
								</p>
								<p>
									Some other projects that I got to work on were the fire damper project and the mechanical riser plan. Both involved
									updating old schematics that were out of date and needed to be revised. For the fire damper project we surveyed 
									the building and traced fire dampers for the purpose of ensuring that the building was up to the safety codes.
									For the mechanical riser we had schematics that display the most up to date piping, plumbing and assets that are 
									located to each respective building. This involved going through various projects in chronological order and 
									ensuring that any construction or demolition was reflected on the schematic.
